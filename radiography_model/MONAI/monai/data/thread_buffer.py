    """
    Iterates over values from self.src in a separate thread but yielding them in the current thread. This allows values
    to be queued up asynchronously. The internal thread will continue running so long as the source has values or until
    the stop() method is called.

    One issue raised by using a thread in this way is that during the lifetime of the thread the source object is being
    iterated over, so if the thread hasn't finished another attempt to iterate over it will raise an exception or yield
    unexpected results. To ensure the thread releases the iteration and proper cleanup is done the stop() method must
    be called which will join with the thread.
