    Derived from `create_supervised_trainer` in Ignite.

    Factory function for creating a trainer for supervised models.

        net: the network to train.
        optimizer: the optimizer to use.
        loss_fn: the loss function to use.
        devices: device(s) type specification (default: None).
            Applies to both model and batches. None is all devices used, empty list is CPU only.
        non_blocking: if True and this copy is between CPU and GPU, the copy may occur asynchronously
            with respect to the host. For other cases, this argument has no effect.

            tuple of tensors `(batch_x, batch_y)`.

            to be assigned to engine's state.output after each iteration. Default is returning `loss.item()`.
        distributed: whether convert model to `DistributedDataParallel`, if have multiple devices, use
            the first device as output device.

    Returns:
        Engine: a trainer engine with supervised update function.

    Note:
        `engine.state.output` for this engine is defined by `output_transform` parameter and is the loss
        of the processed batch by default.
