    CheckpointLoader acts as an Ignite handler to load checkpoint data from file.
    It can load variables for network, optimizer, lr_scheduler, etc.
    If saving checkpoint after `torch.nn.DataParallel`, need to save `model.module` instead
    as PyTorch recommended and then use this loader to load the model.

    Args:
        load_path: the file path of checkpoint, it should be a PyTorch `pth` file.
        load_dict: target objects that load checkpoint to. examples::

            {'network': net, 'optimizer': optimizer, 'lr_scheduler': lr_scheduler}

        name: identifier of logging.logger to use, if None, defaulting to ``engine.logger``.
        map_location: when loading the module for distributed training/evaluation,
            need to provide an appropriate map_location argument to prevent a process
            to step into othersâ€™ devices. If map_location is missing, torch.load will
            first load the module to CPU and then copy each parameter to where it was
            saved, which would result in all processes on the same machine using the
            same set of devices.
