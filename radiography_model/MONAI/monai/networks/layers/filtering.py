class BilateralFilter(torch.autograd.Function):
    """
    Blurs the input tensor spatially whilst preserving edges. Can run on 1D, 2D, or 3D,
    tensors (on top of Batch and Channel dimensions). Two implementations are provided,
    an exact solution and a much faster approximation which uses a permutohedral lattice.

    See:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter
        https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/permutohedral/

    Args:
        input: input tensor.

        spatial sigma: the standard deviation of the spatial blur. Higher values can
            hurt performace when not using the approximate method (see fast approx).

        color sigma: the standard deviation of the color blur. Lower values preserve
            edges better whilst higher values tend to a simple gaussian spatial blur.

        fast approx: This flag chooses between two implementations. The approximate method may
            produce artifacts in some scenarios whereas the exact solution may be intolerably
            slow for high spatial standard deviations.

    Returns:
        output (torch.Tensor): output tensor.

    Filters input based on arbitrary feature vectors. Uses a permutohedral

    filtering. Complexity is broadly independent of kernel size. Most applicable
    to higher filter dimensions and larger kernel sizes.
