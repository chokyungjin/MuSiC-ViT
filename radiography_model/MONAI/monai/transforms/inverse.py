class InvertibleTransform(Transform):
    """Classes for invertible transforms.

    This class exists so that an ``invert`` method can be implemented. This allows, for
    example, images to be cropped, rotated, padded, etc., during training and inference,
    and after be returned to their original size before saving to file for comparison in
    an external viewer.

    When the ``__call__`` method is called, the transformation information for each key is
    stored. If the transforms were applied to keys "image" and "label", there will be two
    extra keys in the dictionary: "image_transforms" and "label_transforms". Each list
    contains a list of the transforms applied to that key. When the ``inverse`` method is
    called, the inverse is called on each key individually, which allows for different
    parameters being passed to each label (e.g., different interpolation for image and
    label).

    When the ``inverse`` method is called, the inverse transforms are applied in a last-
    in-first-out order. As the inverse is applied, its entry is removed from the list
    detailing the applied transformations. That is to say that during the forward pass,
    the list of applied transforms grows, and then during the inverse it shrinks back
    down to an empty list.

    The information in ``data[key_transform]`` will be compatible with the default collate
    since it only stores strings, numbers and arrays.

    We currently check that the ``id()`` of the transform is the same in the forward and
    inverse directions. This is a useful check to ensure that the inverses are being
    processed in the correct order. However, this may cause issues if the ``id()`` of the
    object changes (such as multiprocessing on Windows). If you feel this issue affects
    you, please raise a GitHub issue.

    Note to developers: When converting a transform to an invertible transform, you need to:

        #. Inherit from this class.
        #. In ``__call__``, add a call to ``push_transform``.
        #. Any extra information that might be needed for the inverse can be included with the
           dictionary ``extra_info``. This dictionary should have the same keys regardless of
           whether ``do_transform`` was `True` or `False` and can only contain objects that are
           accepted in pytorch data loader's collate function (e.g., `None` is not allowed).
        #. Implement an ``inverse`` method. Make sure that after performing the inverse,
           ``pop_transform`` is called.
