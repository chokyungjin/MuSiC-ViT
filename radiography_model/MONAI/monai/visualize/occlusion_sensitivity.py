class OcclusionSensitivity:
    """
    This class computes the occlusion sensitivity for a model's prediction of a given image. By occlusion sensitivity,
    we mean how the probability of a given prediction changes as the occluded section of an image changes. This can be
    useful to understand why a network is making certain decisions.

    As important parts of the image are occluded, the probability of classifying the image correctly will decrease.
    Hence, more negative values imply the corresponding occluded volume was more important in the decision process.

    Two ``torch.Tensor`` will be returned by the ``__call__`` method: an occlusion map and an image of the most probable
    class. Both images will be cropped if a bounding box used, but voxel sizes will always match the input.

    The occlusion map shows the inference probabilities when the corresponding part of the image is occluded. Hence,
    more -ve values imply that region was important in the decision process. The map will have shape ``BCHW(D)N``,
    where ``N`` is the number of classes to be inferred by the network. Hence, the occlusion for class ``i`` can
    be seen with ``map[...,i]``.

    The most probable class is an image of the probable class when the corresponding part of the image is occluded
    (equivalent to ``occ_map.argmax(dim=-1)``).
